It was shortly after the 2020 Boxing Day hail storm, where entire crops of apples were wiped out in a freak, but increasingly occurring weather related disaster. A lot of the crop was totally edible but there were few retailers that wanted to buy the ugly fruit. It wasn’t just apples but kiwifruit, grapes and veggies too, leaving growers with no income and a lot of damage. We returned home to Wellington jobless, and this is where Wonky Box was born.<\/p><p><\/p><p>We started out doing up boxes on the living room floor and collecting produce from the Horowhenua in our campervan. In a moment of madness, we though it would be smart to deliver overnight. This was quickly scrapped. From back garden, to class room, small warehouse to big chiller and now Auckland, this is our Wonky journey in a few pictures. There’ll be plenty more to come.
